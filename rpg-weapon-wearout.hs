-- The aim of this problem is as follows:

-- 1. Begin with a simple rpg system, where you model a player with some items. The player uses the items to cause some effects. In the beginning, the items are all static, a sword does some damage.
-- 2. Later the problem owner changes the problem slightly -> items can now wear out over use/time. How easy is it to update the code to deal with this change?

-- In a OOP world, you would probably change the constant to a field in the Object, how would we do it here?
